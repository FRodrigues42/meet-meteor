Lesson plan
===

Get to grips with Meteor by building demos and apps. This course is a hands on, learn through doing roller coaster ride of Meteor awesome. Follow along with the tutor as they live code the initial stages of each example application. Then you take over and finish each app, with points for completing bonus tasks.

1. Database everywhere
---
In "database everywhere" we explore how developers can interact with data sets on both the server _and_ the client. You'll learn about the methods Meteor uses to transfer data, how to use the Meteor database API and how to manage what data is sync'd between client and server.

You'll gain hands on experience coding three separate examples demonstrating different "database everywhere" topics. The first example gives you an intro into the Meteor MongoDB API. The second example teaches you how to control what goes into your database through the use of access control rules. The third example introduces pub/sub and walks you through creating your own instant messaging client.

Topics covered:
* Client side MongoDB
* Data on the wire
* Pub/sub
* Access control
* Latency compensation

Technologies used:
* JavaScript
* MongoDB
* Websockets

~ 3 hours

2. Reactivity - coping with change
---
"Reactivity" aims to teach you how to build a Meteor application whose DOM updates automatically, reflecting changes in the data that backs it.

You'll spend most of the session building an image search engine, the "moustachery", which will introduce you to creating reactive templates that respond to data changes originating from both the client and the server. You'll start from a plain page of HTML and CSS and quickly add functionality as you follow along with the presenter live coding the initial stages. You'll then complete the application by adding in the remaining functionality.

Attendance at the first session "database everywhere" is strongly recommended but not required.

Topics covered:
* Reactive programming
* Live HTML
* Meteor Handlebars extensions
* Event maps

Technologies used:
* JavaScript
* HTML
* Handlebars
* MongoDB
* Websockets

~ 2 hours

3. Parcelling out
---
In "parcelling out" you'll gain insight into the Meteor package system and surrounding tools, learning about popular packages that provide commonly requested functionality.

You'll learn about tools that allow you to install non-core packages for use in your application and be introduced to "Iron Router" - a package that allows you to create multi-page applications by defining URL routes. You'll be shown the accounts-ui package, a drop in account registration/sign in and forgotten password package and you'll also see how you can easily add twitter/facebook/google or github sign in to your app.

No prior session attendance required.

Topics covered:
* Mereorite/Atmosphere
* Routing with Iron Router
* Accounts
* Intergation with single sign on systems

Technologies used:
n/a
